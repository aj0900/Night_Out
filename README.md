This respository contains .html and .css files that were intended to be for a website called Night Out. The idea of night out
was to help users plan their night out by in regards of what bars have what deals, what type of music, hours of operation, etc.
The plan was to use yelp and numuerous other APIs to get information regarding restaurants and bars. Due to time constraints
the project was not able to reach its full potential. This project is not a final product.
